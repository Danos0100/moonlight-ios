## Building
* Install Xcode from the [App Store page](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
* Run `git clone --recursive https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-ios.git`
  *  If you've already clone the repo without `--recursive`, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* Open Moonlight.xcodeproj in Xcode
* To run on a real device, you will need to locally modify the signing options. Add `credentials.xcconfig` file to `Configurations` folder with content:

```
PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = <Bundle Identifier> // Change the "Bundle Identifier" to something different. You can add your name or some random letters to make it unique.
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = <Team ID> // Team ID can be found in your development account
```
